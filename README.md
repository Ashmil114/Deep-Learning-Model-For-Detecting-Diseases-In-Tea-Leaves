## Introduction
Tea leaf diseases can significantly impact the yield and quality of tea. This project aims to develop a deep learning model to detect various diseases in tea leaves using image classification techniques.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ashmil114/Deep-Learning-Model-For-Detecting-Diseases-In-Tea-Leaves.git
cd Deep-Learning-Model-For-Detecting-Diseases-In-Tea-Leaves
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Start the Flask server to serve the model. This will allow you to make predictions via API calls.

```bash
python app.py
```
